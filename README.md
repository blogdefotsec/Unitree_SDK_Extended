## Unitree SDK2 Extended

Hi :)

This project is an extend for the Unitree SDK2 (DDS version) and the SLAM package. (Maybe more in the future), not for a official version.

All the functions are based on the Unitree SDK2, so you might install the SDK first, for the beginers to develop the Unitree robots like G1/Go2/B2 that support develop by [Unitree SDK2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2)

And also include some docs for the beginers developing with Unitree SDK2 and this extend.
