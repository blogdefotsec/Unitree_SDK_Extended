  By not providing "Findcatkin_boost_python_buildtool.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "catkin_boost_python_buildtool", but CMake

  Add the installation prefix of "catkin_boost_python_buildtool" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "catkin_boost_python_buildtool_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "catkin_boost_python_buildtool"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
